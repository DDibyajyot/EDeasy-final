Any child who wants to receive education in subjects like mathematics or languages like english, can visit our site to find a collection of free open-source textbooks and other resources that do not necessarily follow a specific curricula, or testing system. They are self-paced and cover grades 6-10 in the standard education system. This is to provide an opportunity of learning to anyone who may not be able to afford a school-based education, home-schoolers as well as anyone who wants to enrich their existing learning process! Thereâ€™s very little awareness about such resources in the market, and our website hopes to make it easy for children, especially of an underprivileged background to become literate.
